# todolist-database
Full Stack To Do List Project, built using  MongoDB &amp; Mongoose, JavaScript, EJS, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Node, Nodemon. Deployed with MongoDB Atlas and Heroku, using Git and the Command Line (Hyper Terminal).

# How it works:

In each To Do List: 
You can add and delete items from the To Do List. 
You add an item by typing text and then pressing the "+" button. 
You delete an ithem by clicking on the corresponding checkbox. 

You can add your own To Do Lists. 
You type /NameOfYourList after the web address, so in the end the web address looks like this:
https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/warm-retreat-48757/NameOfYourList
It does not matter whether you use block or capital letters. The app will automatically display the capitalized version of the name you have chosen as a title of your list.

All the lists and their corresponding items are being stored online on MongoDB Atlas and the admin has access to them. 

The app has an "About" Page which can be reached by adding /about at the end of the web address.
